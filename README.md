Example project that leverages HealthKit to nudge users into target heart rate zones in a variety of workouts.

## About 
This sample project was originally presented at the May 2016 meeting of [Nashville CocoaHeads](http://www.cocoaheads.org/us/NashvilleTennessee/index.html). This code is very rough so proceed at your own risk. The main goal was to demonstrate fetching and storing data from HealthKit in realtime.

The project includes a watchOS app that is capable of starting a HKWorkoutSession and sending heart rate readings from HealthKit to the companion iOS app. The companion iOS app allows the user to select a workout and see if their heart rate is within the their target heart rate range for the selected workout.
